        <p class="lead"><strong>The Cardening</strong> is an application for interactively playing card games with friends over the internet.</p>
        <p>What makes <strong>The Cardening</strong> unique is that no game rules are enforced except those by players. Players decide whether to show opponents cards and/or to rotate and move individual cards. Players can chat and call one another out during play. Additionally players can upload sprite images for decks of cards and play any card game desired with them.</p>
